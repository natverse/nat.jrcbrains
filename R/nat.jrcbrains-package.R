#' The main purpose of this package is to distribute bridging registrations
#' mapping between template brains constructed at Janelia Research Campus by
#' Stephan Saalfeld's group. These registrations are not directly distributed
#' with the package but must be downloaded. See
#' \code{\link{download_saalfeldlab_registrations}} for details.
#'
#' Once the appropriate registrations have been downloaded, loading the
#' package is sufficient to make them available to end users / other packages.
#' See \code{\link{register_saalfeldlab_registrations}}.
