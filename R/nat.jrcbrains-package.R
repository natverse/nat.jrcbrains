#' @description The main purpose of this package is to distribute bridging
#'   registrations mapping between template brains constructed at Janelia
#'   Research Campus by Stephan Saalfeld's group. These registrations are not
#'   directly distributed with the package but must be downloaded. See
#'   \code{\link{download_saalfeldlab_registrations}} for details.
#'
#'   Once the appropriate registrations have been downloaded, loading the
#'   package is sufficient to make them available to end users / other packages.
#'   See \code{\link{register_saalfeldlab_registrations}}.
