Description: Provides convenient download and application of bridging 
    registrations linking different Drosophila template brains. After download,
    registrations can be applied to a range of data types using the `natverse` 
    suite of tools and combined with a range of other bridging registrations.
    These registrations were originally developed by John
    Bogovic in the group of Stephan Saalfeld at HHMI Janelia Research Campus.
